## Getting Started Againâ„¢

1. In JupyterLab, open a Launcher and select `Terminal`
4. Type in `cd CMPINF0010`
    - Or, if you named your class folder something different, replace `CMPINF0010` with whatever you named your folder
5. Now, copy and paste this command into the terminal
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/week-4.git
    ```
    - If you can't seem to paste anything, try using Ctrl+Shift+V (or Command+Shift+V)
6. You should see a new folder named `week-4` inside your class folder

### If JupyterLab _really_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

Click this button to get started with Binder:

## Submitting your finished lab

This lab is due at 11:59 PM the night before your next lab session.

1. In JupyterHub or Binder, navigate to your folder for this week's lab
2. In the file browser on the left side of your screen, right click on the notebook that you will be submitting
    - If you need to submit multiple files, hold control (command on Mac) and click on the files that you need
3. Click `Download`
    - Also click `Allow` if your browser asks you if it's okay to download multiple files
4. Now, zip the file(s) up
    - Windows:
        - In File Explorer, select the files (control-click if you have multiple)
        - Right click -> Send to -> Compressed (zipped) folder
    - MacOS:
        - In Finder, select the files (command-click if you have multiple)
        - Control-click (or two-finger click) the files
        - Click compress
5. Now for the most important part: **_RENAME_** the zip file!
    - The format you should use is: `abc123-week-2-lab.zip`
        - Replace abc123 with your username and week-2 with the current week
6. Once the file is renamed, open up Box
    - You can access it from [my.pitt.edu](https://my.pitt.edu)
7. In the folder `CMPINF0010 Monday Lab Sessions` or `CMPINF0010 Wednesday Lab Sessions` depending on which day you have lab
8. Click and drag your zip file onto the folder
9. Once it's uploaded, you're done!

Note: you can re-upload your lab as many times as you want before the deadline.
